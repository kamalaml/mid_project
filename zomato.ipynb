from that all starters were useless and without taste  Road side wine shops are better than this  And who gave them the place to set up in VR mall  Beer is not at all good and the person there will say this beer not available whatever you ask For  I will strongly recommend not to go there and waste your precious money  Food takes much longer time to be served which should not be an ideal case in a bar or any other beer cafe,  ,   Very chilled out place, go with friends or alone Nice food and drinks are reasonably priced Should try french fries, egg burji and also the pizzas Outside sitting is

their food and customer service dampened our spirits Our order for chicken steak came out as a totally different recipe one in menu was different and they didnt offer any apologies or something to the mistake, instead made us wait for over  minutes for a rehash of the same dish These guys need a tutorial on customer service,  ,   I like this place so much because of its ambience more This is my th visit to Pabloxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxs and every time I liked this place If you like karaoke then please plan to Pabloxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxs on Friday night And definitely you will enjoy your Friday

       "       ',   I had nn Italian Tiramisu Shaken Grilled Ones Burgers ChickennnLoved both the items The shake was really good It whet my appetite for the burger which too was lovely and delectablennThe staff was pleasant and friendly,  ,   Olivers is always the place where people working in ITPL go if they are in mood to chill post worknThis place serves decent pizza and drinks,  ,   I have been to this place couple of times now Found it OK in terms of food, service, ambience, pricing and availability of drinksnOn our st visit we were around people and had ordered chicken starters, beer, wine and pizza However, the service was too slow Even the bill was given to us almost after mins of asking the waitersnDuring nd visit, we were  people This visit was bit disappointing, as almost  of the drinks on menu which I wanted to have were not available Ultimately i had to get a diet coke Even the food menu is a traditional one There is nothing different and the taste is averagenMy friend also tried flame shot here, which was a big disappointment as the waiters who made it seemed amateurs He had struggled so much to drink that flame shot, as the flame was all over the table,  ,   Im pleasantly surprised when I happen to find new places to dine close to homenWith this in mind I stopped by Oliver a while back nOverlooking ITPL, the atmosphere here is well lit and lively especially if you happen to be here during live match screenings nComing to the food I was a bit disappointed nI ordered the buenos nachos and the chicken nachos pizza nTalking about the nachos, they were basically made with cornitos chips nThe crust of the pizza was dry and the toppings lacked seasoning nThe drinks we ordered were just okayishnOverall slightly disappointed,  ,   Ordered chilly pork, which was not really very spicy also most of the pieces were pork fat only and not meat  And the noodles was good but not that good Kind of expected a little bit more from this place Found it a bit overpriced for the quantity,  ,   Good place to hang out and chill with your friends with good food and drinks You would love their range of pizzas and their taste if you like thin crush pizzas  like the Mexican nachos one myself Drinks are good too with offers  mainly people opt for Bira Had sizzling Brownie in desserts and it was yum Can improve more on overall crust and taste of the pizzas though  not that nice if youre going only for food xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcxxxxxxxxcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxx ThinCrustPizzas Bira,  ,   Visited during lunch hoursnThe nachos were pretty filling but just about aboveaverage in tastennI would recommend the Gambas Prawns were succelent and flavourfulnnThe service was also pretty quick Im not sure why the stools were a little worn out and the ambience was a little low and dim Perhaps the aim was to give a rusty vibe but the tables and chairs seemed a little too old and rusted,  ,   Its one of the few places we found open past pm near ITPL, that serves cocktails Its on the first floor of the shopping complex This one cocktail called Hanky Panky was particularly good,  ,   Olivers The place i love for pizzas And hey If you want to just chill, have some beer along with your friends then this is the place for you I personally love their pizzas and the ambience Cheers,  ,   Olivers have been a go to place after office as it is in ITPL itself For drinks they dont keep much options available which is disappointing Coming to food, food is really good We tried chilly chicken, American corn and crispy babycorn for starters and had chilly paneer tikka and spinach paneer pizza Taste and ambience is very much lively and dewy,  ,   This restaurant was a big disappointment The list of unprofessionalism is quite bignWe found a dead cockroach near the table And when pointing it out the service guy was least bothered and asked some other guy to look into itThen we shifted to a different tablenAnother downer was the

plate looks half empty Its just cigarette smoke that u can breathnDid not enjoy the food or ambience,  ,   Went there on a Friday eve They were out of almost every good branded beers Below average food, the place seems a little bit shady Sitting chairs and tables are really rusty Staffs not really pro active in serving you They overcharged me, had to call them and get the amount back So you get the picture,  ,   Olivers Pub is a decent place with a good ambience Food was pretty good although we tried only vegetarian dishes They had limited options for drinks and few of the listed drinks were not even available I had the most amazing Chinese bhel over here I tried two variants of pizzas there  Paneer peri peri and Margherita paneer spinach pizza, both of them were nicely made Please do give a try to the spinach one It was surprisingly delicious xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxb'],\n",
